## Reference Documents Manifesto (v 0.0.1)

An open, transparent and collaborative approach to curating ref docs for WordPress developers (and designers). 

The purpose of these docs is to make more people more effective when they take hold of the tool called WordPress.

"Doing the right thing" is primary, from which "doing things right" follows. 


## Why?

#### The following is a (slightly edited) comment I left on a Torque post that in a soft rant-y sort of way adds some good context:

Obviously sharing is caring. It's what - by definition - a true community does. That said, today's dev & design must-knows eventually rust and quite often become tomorrows' noise. 

Currently, to a WP n00b - and even to well seasoned vets - a Google / Bing SERP is a minefield of truth, propaganda and lies. Put another way, there's a reason there are so many n00b questions in the various (FB) groups. A SERP - due to the accumulation of 10+ years of noise - is a less and less useful tool for even the most basic questions. Yeah, you get an answer. Lots of them! And then it hits you, "Which is the right one? Which is the best for me for this? How do I know?" That's not a good feeling, especially if you find out later you guessed wrong.

The ultimate solution is to change tools. Blog posts / articles are out. Multi-contributor Git (e.g., GitHub) repos for "articles" are in. Less (noise) is more (focus).

Let me explain...

In 2016, The Product isn't simply code and some set of features. Less formal "documentation" (e.g., articles, blog posts, etc.) served via SERPs is also part of The Product. Such suport plays a critical role in the end to end experience and is probably the key hands-on component (of The Product holistically) that influences a dev's experience - for better or for worse. Yet we as a community continue to intentionally restrict the genius of version control to code. Why? 

Fact: Version control is just as effective for words and ideas as it is for code.  

The Product deserves that this documentation be given the same (equal) rights as code and/or features. Going forward, The Product's less formal documentation demands the benefits of open sourcing (i.e., pull requests and the like) that Git / GitHub based platforms provide. 

It just makes better sense. Collect the best articles, when appropriate aggregate them, and repeat. Again, less (noise) is more (focus).

With that said, here's a raw and barely "beta" implementation of the above idea.
